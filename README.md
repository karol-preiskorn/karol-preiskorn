#### Hi coder ðŸ‘‹

May your bugs be rare, your coffee robust, and your undefined always intentional.
Grab your keyboardâ€”letâ€™s refactor that spaghetti into elegant, gourmet code!

I primarily work on back-end development using âœ¨PL/SQLâœ¨ and some years in ABAP. I also enjoy using ðŸ”­Node.js for backend scripting and ðŸ”­Angular for front-end development.

- ðŸ¤” Code is for humans, not just for computers.
- ðŸ‘¯ Code is for the engineers on your team, who read, maintain, and build on top of your code.
- âš¡ Code is for the users, whether itâ€™s a kid on their phone, a developer calling your API, or yourself.
