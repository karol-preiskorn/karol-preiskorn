#### Hi coder I'm Karol Preiskorn 👋
```
May your bugs be rare, your coffee robust, and your undefined always intentional.
Grab your keyboard—let’s refactor that spaghetti into elegant, gourmet code!
```
I primarily work on back-end development using ✨PL/SQL✨ and some years in ABAP. I also enjoy using 🔭Node.js for backend scripting and 🔭Angular for front-end development.

- 🤔 Code is for humans, not just for computers.
- 👯 Code is for the engineers on your team, who read, maintain, and build on top of your code.
- ⚡ Code is for the users, whether it’s a kid on their phone, a developer calling your API, or yourself.

🔭 I’m currently working on an off-work development for learning ✨3D inventory project✨ — a solution that allows you to build spatial and database representations of various types of warehouses and server rooms. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about promises and reactive forms in Angular on Prular and Node.js on Inversible Labs.
