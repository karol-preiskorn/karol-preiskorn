#### Hi coder 👋

May your bugs be few, your coffee strong, and your `undefined` always be `not a problem`. Grab your keyboard and let’s turn some spaghetti into clean, gourmet code! 

I primarily work on back-end development using ✨PL/SQL✨ and some years in ABAP. I also enjoy using 🔭Node.js for backend scripting and 🔭Angular for front-end development.
