#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I primarily work on back-end development using PL/SQL and some years in ABAP. I also enjoy using Node.js for backend scripting and Angular for front-end development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an off-work development for learning âœ¨3D inventory projectâœ¨ â€” a solution that allows you to build spatial and database representations of various types of warehouses and server rooms.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about promises and reactive forms in Angular.
