## 💡 Philosophy

```
May your bugs be few and vanish with grace,
Coffee strong, fueling your coding race.
Let "undefined" be no accident's trace—
But chosen with purpose, in its rightful place.

So grab your keyboard, take your stand,
Refactor boldly with steady hand.
From tangled spaghetti, let brilliance unfold—
Turn chaos to structure, and clunkers to gold!
```

- 🤔 Code is for humans, not just for computers.
- 👯 Code is for the engineers on your team, who read, maintain, and build on top of your code.
- ⚡ Code is for the users, whether it’s a kid on their phone, a developer calling your API, or yourself.
