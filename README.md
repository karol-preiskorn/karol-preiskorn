## 💡 Philosophy

> May your bugs be rare, your coffee robust, and your `undefined` always intentional.  
> Grab your keyboard—let’s refactor that spaghetti into elegant, gourmet code!
- 🤔 Code is for humans, not just for computers.
- 👯 Code is for the engineers on your team, who read, maintain, and build on top of your code.
- ⚡ Code is for the users, whether it’s a kid on their phone, a developer calling your API, or yourself.
